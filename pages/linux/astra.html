        Astra Linux is an operating system based on the Linux kernel, which is being implemented in Russia as an alternative to Microsoft Windows.Ensures the degree of protection of the processed information up to the level of state secrets of "special importance" inclusive.
      <br><br><br>
      Features of the Special Edition version:
      <br><br>
      Since the release of 2021 (1.7/4.7), the security modes "Basic" ("Eagle", non-certified version), "Enhanced" ("Voronezh") and "Maximum" ("Smolensk") are available in Astra Linux Special Edition. The "Enhanced" mode has all the features of the "Basic" mode and complements them, the "Maximum" mode has all the features of the "Enhanced" mode and also complements them.
      <br><br>
      In the "Enhanced" mode, mechanisms of mandatory integrity control and a closed software environment are available, significantly increasing the protection of the OS from hacking, viruses, seizure of authority, etc. The PARSEC security subsystem, which enters the "Enhanced" mode, is developed on the basis of a verified formal security model for access control and information flows (M-DP model).
      <br><br>
      In the "Maximum" mode, a full set of information security tools is available, including mandatory access control for local and server infrastructure.
      <br><br>
      Starting with the "Enhanced" mode, the interfaces of the Astra Linux Special Edition information security tools significantly narrow the attack surface, and form the main line of defense against malicious external influence.
      <br><br>
      Since 2018, the Linux kernel with enhanced self-protection (hardened) with the integration of the developments of the KSPP (Kernel Self Protection Project) project has been included in the distribution.
      <br><br>
      Cleaning of RAM and external memory and guaranteed deletion of files: the operating system cleans unused blocks of the file system directly when they are released, using masking sequences.
      <br><br>
      Document labeling: The developed labeling mechanism allows the print server (CUPS) to put down the necessary credentials in the printed documents. Mandatory attributes are automatically associated with the print job based on the mandatory context of the received network connection. It is impossible to print documents without marking by access subjects working in a mandatory context with the "unclassified" stamp above.
      <br><br>
      Event logging: an advanced logging subsystem integrated into all components of the operating system and performing reliable event logging using a special parlogd service.
      <br><br>
      Information protection mechanisms in the graphics subsystem: the graphics subsystem includes the Xorg X server, the Fly user desktop, as well as a number of software tools designed for both users and system administrators. Work has been carried out to create and embed into the graphics subsystem the necessary information protection mechanisms that ensure the implementation of mandatory access control in graphical applications running in their own isolated environment.
