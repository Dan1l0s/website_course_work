        Linux Mint was released on August 27, 2006, Linux Mint provides full support for a variety of multimedia formats, includes some proprietary programs and comes bundled with an extensive set of open source applications.
        <br><br><br>
        Releases and Versions:
        <br><br>
        Unlike Linux Mint distributions based on Ubuntu, the LMDE versions are floating and have a release date in their name (in YYYY-MM format), and not a version number with a codename. Previously, they were based on Debian Testing, but later switched to Stable releases.
        <br><br>
        The first version of LMDE is 201009, it was released on September 7, 2010. The next version was 201012, and the subsequent correction 201101. On March 21, 2011, the Linux Mint 10 Xfce Edition was transferred to the LMDE base, the Linux Mint 10 Fluxbox Edition is planned to be translated. There is no consensus on the transfer of the LXDE CE and KDE CE editions to the Debian base.
        <br><br>
        Snap packages and snapd are no longer available in version 20 of Ulyana. Automatic installation of snapd together with other packages installed via APT is also prohibited. If desired, snapd can be installed manually.
