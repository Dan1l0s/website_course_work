        Kali Linux - GNU/Linux-LiveCD, which arose as a result of the merger of WHAX and Auditor Security Collection. The project was created by Mati Aharoni and Max Moser. It is intended primarily for conducting safety tests. The heir of the BackTrack distribution developed until 2013 on the basis of Knoppix.

        Features:
        <br><br>
        Since version 2019.4 (November 2019), the desktop has been switched from GNOME to Xfce by default, while the GNOME version is still available.
        <br><br>
        Kali Linux has a dedicated project designed for compatibility and porting to specific Android devices called Kali Linux NetHunter.
        <br><br>
        This is the first open source penetration testing platform for Nexus devices, created as a joint effort between Kali community member "BinkyBear" and "Offensive Security". It supports the installation of an 802.11 wireless frame, unidirectional configuration of the MANA Evil access point, HID keyboard (such as Teensy type attacks), as well as Bad USB MITM attacks.
        <br><br>
        BackTrack (Kali's predecessor) included a mode known as "forensic mode", which was ported to Kali via LiveBoot. This mode is very popular for many reasons, partly because many Kali users already have a bootable Kali USB drive or CD, and this option makes it easier to apply Kali to court work. When booting in "forensic mode", the system does not touch the internal hard drive or swap space, and automatic installation is disabled. However, the developers recommend that users thoroughly test these features before using Kali in "forensic mode"
