        Ubuntu was released on October 20, 2004, now it is one of the most popular Linux distributions. The main developer and sponsor is Canonical. Currently, the project is actively developing and supported by the free community.
        <br><br><br>
        Features:
        <br><br>
        Ubuntu is focused on convenience and ease of use. It includes widespread use of the sudo utility, which allows users to perform administrative tasks without starting a potentially dangerous superuser session.
        <br><br>
        Ubuntu, in addition, has a developed internationalization that ensures maximum accessibility for representatives of different language groups. Since version 5.04, the default encoding is UTF-8.
        <br><br>
        Ubuntu is recommended to have at least 4 gigabytes of RAM for work, and when installed on a hard disk — from five gigabytes of free space, and the minimum requirements are much lower.
        <br><br>
        Ubuntu (prior to version 11.04) was based on the GNOME desktop environment, which is designed to provide a free, simple and intuitive interface, offering a full range of modern desktop applications. In addition to those applications that are included in GNOME, Ubuntu comes out with additional software, including LibreOffice (OpenOffice.org prior to version 11.04), Mozilla Firefox web browser.
        <br><br>
        Version 6.06 and later combine the Live CD and the installation CD into one CD. This disk loads the desktop with all the features, giving users the opportunity to find out if their hardware is supported, and experiment with available applications, and only then install Ubuntu on the hard disk using the Ubiquity graphical installer ("ubiquity"). However, you can proceed directly to the installation. The installation process saves the documents created on the "live" desktop. An alternative installation using debian-installer is available for download and is aimed at people who understand the system at a deeper level, administrators who install many systems, and for complex partitioning of disks, including the use of LVM or RAID, as well as for installations with less than 192 megabytes of RAM. The distribution package also includes a program for creating a bootable Live USB based on a USB Flash drive that has all the features of a Live CD and an installation CD. This is convenient for use, for example, on netbooks. However, on older computers, there is not always an option to boot from a USB flash drive.
        <br><br>
        The default user interface in early versions was characterized by shades of brown and orange. Ubuntu has an additional package called ubuntu-calendar, which downloads new wallpapers matching the brown color theme every month. In the past, these wallpapers featured partially nude people, so they were criticized as risky. This led to the creation of nicknames such as "Linuxxx". The Ubuntu interface has been rebranded, noticeable since version 10.04: the logo has been changed, the color scheme has been changed from shades of brown and orange to black and purple. According to some users, the new Ubuntu interface began to resemble the Mac OS X interface. When developing Ubuntu components, the Python programming language is actively used.
