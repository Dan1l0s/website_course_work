        Windows 10 was released on July 29, 2015, now this operating system is the most popular among the Windows family, upgrading to this system was free for all users with Windows 7 and Windows 8 operating systems for a year after the release of Windows 10.
        <br><br><br>
        The main differences from Windows 8.1:
        <br><br>
        The updated Start menu will allow the user to view lists of frequently used applications and files in one click, as well as configure applications, programs, contacts and websites. It is possible to pin tiles in the Start menu, and if the tiles are not needed, they can be removed. The user can adjust the size of the Start menu (height, width), the ability to use the menu in full-screen mode has been preserved.
        <br><br>
        Recently installed applications are located in the middle of the Start menu applications list, and are not displayed and highlighted when the All Programs dialog opens, as it was in previous versions of Windows.
        <br><br>
        UWP apps of the Microsoft Store (formerly the Windows Store) now open in windowed mode. Using the new button in the window header, you can expand the application to full screen (if it supports this).
        <br><br>
        The "miracle buttons" panel has been replaced by a "Notification Center" with quick settings buttons. Now they are available only in the application management menu in the window header. Notifications sync with other devices running on Windows 10.
        <br><br>
        Task view buttons have been added to the taskbar, including the virtual desktop menu (you can also open the task view screen using the Win+Tab key combination), and the Notification Center, a new search bar with an integrated Cortana voice assistant. Voice activation allows you to call the search with the command "Hey, Cortana". Among Cortana 's features:
        <br><br>
        Displaying reminders by time, places and people.
        <br><br>
        Tracking departures, groups, interests and flights.
        <br><br>
        Sending emails and SMS.
        <br><br>
        Calendar management and provision of up-to-date information.
        <br><br>
        The improved Snap feature allows you to open 4 applications at once at the same time and tells you which other applications are running and how they can be placed.
        <br><br>
        Some icons have been redrawn. Also, windows now have a more modern animation of opening and closing. Changed the animation when installing programs.
        <br><br>
        In the new OS, the window frames have become thinner, and their interface has also been changed.
        <br><br>
        The Continuum mode will allow you to interact simultaneously with both the touch interface and the traditional one on hybrid devices — that is, it will allow you to connect a monitor, mouse and keyboard to the phone, the function is promised for "selected" models of new premium devices "in the near future".
        <br><br>
        The welcome screen and lock screen have been updated.
        <br><br>
        The Support Center in Windows 10 has been renamed "Security and Maintenance".
        <br><br>
        The Storage Sense function allows you to save applications from the Microsoft Store not only to the hard disk, but also to the memory card.
        <br><br>
        Windows Media Center is missing. The user cannot purchase it separately, as it was in Windows 8 and Windows 8.1. When upgrading from Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 to Windows 10, the application is removed from the system.
        <br><br>
        The classic games "Minesweeper", "Klondike", "Hearts" and others have been removed. Instead, the UWP application "Microsoft Solitaire Collection" is preinstalled in the system.
        <br><br>
        Tablet mode, designed for touch-screen devices, launches all applications and the Start menu in full screen. In tablet mode, you can attach only two apps.
        <br><br>
        Windows command lines in Windows 10 can now be changed without any restrictions, you can expand the entire screen by pressing Alt+↵ Enter, and use standard keyboard shortcuts, for example, for cutting, copying and pasting. Other features have also been added, such as word wrap and transparency. These functions can be disabled to return to the old console, if necessary.
