        Windows 8.1 was released on October 17, 2013, initially it was a major update for all Windows 8 users, which was subsequently released as a separate operating system. It is focused on working with touch PCs, but it can also be used in "classic" computers.
        <br><br><br>
        The main differences from Windows 8:
        <br><br>
        Internet Explorer has been updated to version 11. The new version supports the WebGL and SPDY protocols, improves the JavaScript object model and the ability to synchronize tabs.
        <br><br>
        Windows PowerShell v4.0: The new version allows you to manage the start screen, Windows Defender, and other software, hardware, and network components of the system.
        <br><br>
        Metro apps installed before the update will not be saved. After the update, some of them will be replaced, the rest will need to be reinstalled yourself.
        <br><br>
        Added Metro applications "Skype", "Alarm Clock", "Calculator", "Recording Studio", "Scanner", "Cooking", "Reading List", "Health and Fitness", "Help+Tips", "Microsoft Solitaire Collection". There are no "Moments from Movies" applications (an application for performing the simplest operations with video) and a file manager. Added the ability to automatically update Metro applications. Settings and commands previously available only through the Desktop Control Panel have been added to the PC Settings application.
        <br><br>
        The ability to synchronize settings and other user data has been changed by deeper integration of the synchronization service with the OneDrive service.
        <br><br>
        In parallel with the work on Windows 8.1, the development of the Microsoft Office Gemini package, a new version of the Microsoft Office package, redesigned for use in the Metro environment and more deeply integrated with cloud services, was carried out
        <br><br>
        There are some additional features in the Charms panel, including sending or printing a screenshot of the application and playing this content on other devices. The search function has also been redesigned by pairing with the Bing search service.
        <br><br>
        The "Pinning applications" function has received support for several applications simultaneously on high-resolution screens (for example, three applications can be placed on a screen with a resolution of 1920x1080). The minimum resolution for Snap View operation is 1024x768 pixels.
        <br><br>
        It is now possible to open the desktop immediately after logging in, as it was in previous operating systems before Windows 8. Also in Windows 8.1, the "Start" button has reappeared, which launches the Modern interface.
        <br><br>
        By many, a significant increase in the capabilities of the Metro interface is considered as the next step in the abolition of the desktop.
        <br><br>
        The ability to use multiple Modern applications simultaneously on non-wide-screen monitors.
        <br><br>
        Additional sizes for "tiles": very large and very small.
        <br><br>
        Additional gestures, including opening the "All Applications" page by sliding the screen down.
        <br><br>
        Advanced personalization features available through the "Personalization" item of the Start screen settings.
        <br><br>
        The lock screen has the ability to change images after a certain period of time (images can be used both from local sources and from the OneDrive cloud).
        <br><br>
        Now it is possible to transfer or change the size of several or all tiles at once.
