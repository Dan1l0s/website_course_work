        Windows 8 was released on October 26, 2012, it was the first operating system of the Windows family not with a skewomorphic design - it used a flat design in the Metro style. Since this product was the first with a similar design, there were many flaws in it, which the company fixed in the Windows 8.1 version.
        <br><br><br>
        Main innovations:
        <br><br>
        Microsoft account and settings synchronization: The ability to log in to Windows using a Live ID. This will allow you to log in to the user profile and download add-ons over the Internet, and also adds integration with OneDrive.
        <br><br>
        Microsoft Store App Store: The only way to buy and download Metro apps, as well as desktop apps in Windows RT.
        <br><br>
        Two new methods for user authentication: a picture password that allows the user to log in with three touches, and a four-digit PIN code, as well as built-in support for biometric devices. The password of the non-local user account corresponds to the password of the Microsoft account.
        <br><br>
        Internet Explorer 10. IE 10 in Windows 8 is included in desktop and touch versions. The latter does not support plugins or ActiveX, but includes a version of Adobe Flash Player, which is optimized for touch control.
        <br><br>
        Conductor. Explorer includes a Ribbon ribbon (similar to the ribbon in Microsoft Office and Windows Essentials) and improvements in ways to resolve conflicts when transferring or copying files.
        <br><br>
        System recovery. Two new functions have been added: Restore (English Refresh) and Reset (English Reset). Recovery for Windows returns all system files to their original state, while preserving all settings, user files and applications. Resetting returns the computer to factory settings.[5]
        <br><br>
        New task manager. In Windows 8, the task manager has been completely changed. Added new performance charts, optimized management of running applications, background processes and services on a single "Performance" tab. Also, the management of auto-uploads from the "System Configuration" was transferred to the task manager.
        <br><br>
        The "Family Security" function has been built into Windows, family security is managed in the control panel.
        <br><br>
        Personalization: After launching, a picture with the current time and date appears on the screen. To get started, you need to press any button by opening the welcome screen. The picture itself can be changed in the settings. Added auto-detection of colors in desktop themes.
        <br><br>
        A new Metro UI-style control panel that allows you to quickly change some system settings.
        <br><br>
        Advanced search: On the home screen, you just need to press any key to start searching for applications, parameters, etc
        . <br><br>
