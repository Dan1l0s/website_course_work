        Windows 7 was released on October 22, 2009, but many users have used it so far - since it was becoming increasingly difficult to support old operating systems for new programs, Microsoft decided to stop supporting this OS in 2020, but they left the possibility of paid support until January 2023, when support will be completely discontinued..
        <br>
        In the Windows NT line, the system has a version number 6.1 (Windows 2000 — 5.0, Windows XP — 5.1, Windows Server 2003 — 5.2, Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 — 6.0).
        <br><br>
        Main Features:
        <br><br>
        Unicode 5.1 support is implemented in this operating system. The Instant Search search bar began to recognize more languages.
        <br><br>
        This OS has support for multi-touch control.
        <br><br>
        All OS versions include 50 new fonts. Existing fonts have been modified to correctly display all characters. Windows 7 is the first version of Windows that includes more fonts for displaying non—Latin characters than for displaying Latin ones. The font control panel has also been improved — by default, it displays only those fonts for which the layout is installed in the system.
        <br><br>
        Windows 7 supports aliases for folders internally. For example, the Program Files folder in some localized versions of Windows was translated and displayed with the translated name, but at the file system level it remained English. Also, the system (except for the Windows 7 Starter and Windows 7 Home Basic versions) has about 120 backgrounds built in, unique for each country and language version. So, the Russian version includes the theme "Russia" with six unique high-resolution wallpapers.
        <br><br>
        An additional advantage of Windows 7 can be considered closer integration with driver manufacturers. Most drivers are detected automatically, while in 90% of cases backward compatibility with drivers for Windows Vista is maintained.
        <br><br>
        Windows 7 also improved compatibility with older applications, some of which were impossible to run on Windows Vista. This is especially true for old games developed under Windows XP. Windows XP Mode has also appeared in Windows 7, which allows you to run old applications in a Windows XP virtual machine, which provides almost complete support for old applications.
        <br><br>
        The new, 11th version of DirectX, first released as part of this OS, has the following improvements: added support for new computational shaders, the possibility of multithreaded rendering, improved tessellation, new texture compression algorithms, etc.
        <br><br>
        Windows Media Player 12 received a new interface and became truly "omnivorous", unlike its predecessor, which required a large number of codecs to play. However, it cannot play licensed Blu-ray discs with videos, but it has the ability to read and write data to them.
        <br><br>
        The Remote Desktop function has also undergone changes. Support for the Aero Peek interface, Direct 2D and Direct3D 10.1 was introduced, support for multiple monitors, multimedia extensions, DirectShow, as well as the ability to play audio with low latency.
        <br><br>
        Branch Cache network technology allows you to cache the contents of Internet traffic. If a user on a local network needs a file that has already been uploaded by one of the users of his network, he will be able to get it from the local cache storage, and not use a channel with limited bandwidth. The technology is designed for large networks and is offered for implementation at enterprises as part of the Corporate and Maximum OS versions.
        <br><br>
        Windows AIK, with which you can create an image with any configurations and settings. Thus, in Windows 7, you can add support for USB 3.0, Bluetooth 4.0, DirectX 11.1 and .NET Framework 4.5 by default.
