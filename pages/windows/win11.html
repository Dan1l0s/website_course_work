        Windows 11 was released on October 5, 2021, this is the last (at the moment) operating system of the Windows family, according to Microsoft, the further work of Windows will be provided as a service, that is, there will be no new operating systems, instead there will be updates and new builds for existing ones (Windows 10 and Windows 11 are currently relevant).
        <br><br><br>
        The main differences from Windows 10:
        <br><br>
        Windows 11, the first release of Windows since 2015, builds on its predecessor, redesigning the user interface in accordance with the new recommendations of Microsoft Fluent Design. The redesign, which focuses on ease of use and flexibility, is accompanied by new productive and social features, as well as security and accessibility updates that address some of the shortcomings of Windows 10.
        <br><br>
        The Microsoft Store, which serves as a single showcase for apps and other content, has also been redesigned in Windows 11. Now Microsoft allows developers to distribute Win32, progressive web applications and other packaging technologies in the Microsoft Store along with standard Universal Windows Platform applications.
        <br><br>
        The Microsoft Teams collaboration platform is integrated into the Windows 11 user interface and is accessible via the taskbar. Skype will no longer be bundled with the default OS.
        <br><br>
        Microsoft touted performance improvements such as smaller update sizes, faster web browsing in "any browser," faster sleep wake times, and faster Windows Hello authentication.
        <br><br>
        Windows 11 will ship with the Chromium-based Microsoft Edge web browser, and will not include or support Internet Explorer, becoming the first version of Windows shipped without Internet Explorer since the release of Windows 95, where Internet Explorer was first bundled with the release of OSR1.
        <br><br>
        The updated Xbox app, as well as Auto HDR and DirectStorage technologies introduced in the Xbox Series X/S, will be integrated into Windows 11; the latter will require a DirectX 12-enabled video card and a solid-state NVMe drive
        <br><br>
        The redesigned interface is present throughout the operating system; translucency, shadows, a new color palette and rounded geometry prevail throughout the user interface. The taskbar buttons are centered by default, and the new Widgets button displays a panel with Microsoft Start, a news aggregator with personalized stories and content (expanding the News and Interests panel introduced in later builds of Windows 10).
        <br><br>
        Black Screen of Death in Windows 11 up to version 22000.346
        <br><br>
        The taskbar is permanently attached to the bottom edge of the screen and cannot be moved to the top, left or right edge of the screen in Windows 11 (although centered icons can be switched to align to the left).
        <br><br>
        The Start menu has been significantly redesigned, instead of the "live tiles" used in Windows 8.x and 10, a grid of "attached" applications has appeared, as well as a list of recent applications and documents.
        <br><br>
        The Task View feature, which appeared in Windows 10, has an updated design and supports the creation of separate wallpapers for each virtual desktop. The window binding functionality has been expanded with two additional features; "layout binding" allows the user to select a predefined layout that he wants to use to place multiple windows on the display. The windows located in the form of a tile can be minimized and restored from the taskbar in the form of a "group of bindings".
        <br><br>
        The Segoe UI font has been updated to a variable version, which has improved its ability to scale between display resolutions. Other changes to the system include new system icons, animations, sounds and widgets. Much of the interface and start menu are heavily inspired by the now-cancelled Windows 10X. A new design for the Explorer and the Parameters application was also presented.
